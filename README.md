#Starchaser

This game is built using Chingu and Gosu.  I took the Gosu tutorial and
added to it.  I implemented my own graphics and created three levels ramping
up the difficulty as you progress.  There is also a casual level that is more 
like the Gosu tutorial added the meteors in to avoid.  There are still somethings
I would like to add and will do so along the way, like a time for the final score
and a highscore list.  Eventually I would like to get this on the web as an app
with either Sinatra or Rails.

Feel free to open any issues you find, Enjoy!
